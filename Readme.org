* SimGrid + microservices experiments

This repository contains material used to prepare, launch and process the
validation of our microservice simulation and code generation tools available
at: [[https://github.com/klementc/internship_simgrid]]

Below can be found a description of the content of this repository.

* Microbenchmarks

  - [[./microbenchmarks]] : readme with information to reproduce the results
  - [[./rabbitmqGo]] : code of the microservice application we developped for the
    microbenchmarks as well as execution scripts used
  - [[./comparison/Comparison_analysis_scenario1.ipynb]],
    [[./comparison/Comparison_analysis_scenario2.ipynb]],
    [[./comparison/Comparison_analysis_scenario3.ipynb]],
    [[./comparison/Comparison_analysis_scenario4.ipynb]], Notebooks with
    visualizations of our data and calibration procedures (you can reuse those
    notebooks with your own data)
 
* TeaStore

  - [[./UseCaseTeaStore/Readme.org]] : readme with information on how to reproduce
    the results
  - [[./UseCaseTeaStore/resources]] : resource files used for the experiment (and
